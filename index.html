                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                  been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                  had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                  course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                  thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                  time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                  switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                  startup. ”

                  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                  learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                  former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                  the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                  They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                  assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                  outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                  no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                  during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                  certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                  receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
